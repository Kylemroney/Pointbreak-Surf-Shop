# Pointbreak-Surf-Shop
The following program is designed to allow a user to purchase four different sized surfboards.
The sizes range from small, medium, large, and squirrel size.
The program revovles around various functions and a loop that helps put together the pricing of each size, being able to read what size the user would like, and how many of that size they would like, along with showing right back to them how much they have picked out, and what their end total will be.
